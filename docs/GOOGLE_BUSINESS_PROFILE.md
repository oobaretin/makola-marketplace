# Google Business Profile – Client Checklist

To help Katy, Sugar Land, and Pearland searchers find Makola when they search for "African groceries," advise your client to:

1. **Claim the Google Business Profile** for "Makola Marketplace."
2. **Add the website URL:**  
   `https://makola-marketplace.vercel.app/`  
   (or your production domain once live.)
3. **Update photos:**  
   Upload photos of the **Shopping List** feature on a phone. This shows customers that the store is modern and tech-friendly.

This site already includes:
- Local SEO metadata (title, description, keywords) targeting "African grocery Houston," "Nigerian food Houston," "Ghanaian market Houston," etc.
- Open Graph tags for social sharing.
- Blog posts that act as landing pages for "West African ingredients Houston" and "Jollof rice shopping list."
